    "## Managing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many open source Python packages for statistics and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To download packages, two popular package managers are **Conda** and **Pip**.  Both Conda and Pip come with the Anaconda distribution.\n",

    "**Conda** is a general-purpose package management system, designed to build and manage software of any type from any language. This means conda can take advantage of many non-python packages (like BLAS, for linear algebra operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pip** is a package manager for python. You may see people using pip with environments using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "- use a [conda environment](#environments)\n",
    "- within this environment, use conda to install base packages such as `pandas` and `numpy`\n",
    "- if a package is not available via conda, then use pip\n",
    "\n",
    "See [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/) for some conda vs pip misconceptions, and why conda is helpful.\n"

    "It is good coding practice to use virtual environments with Python. From [this blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/a-complete-guide-to-python-virtual-environments/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> A Python virtual environment consists of two essential components: the Python interpreter that the virtual environment runs on and a folder containing third-party libraries installed in the virtual environment. These virtual environments are isolated from the other virtual environments, which means any changes on dependencies installed in a virtual environment donâ€™t affect the dependencies of the other virtual environments or the system-wide libraries. Thus, we can create multiple virtual environments with different Python versions, plus different libraries or the same libraries in different versions.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Open Terminal (macOS) or a shell \n",
    "2. Create an environment called `msds534` using Conda with the command:\n",
    "   ```conda create --name msds534```\n",
    "3. To install packages in your environment, first activate your environment:\n",
    "   ```conda activate msds534```\n",
    "4. Then, install the following packages using the command:\n",
    "   ```conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter ipykernel```\n",
    "5. Install PyTorch by running the appropriate command from [here](https://pytorch.org) (for macOS, the command is: `pip3 install torch torchvision`)\n",
    "6. To exit your environment:\n",
    "   ```conda deactivate```\n",
    "\n",
